The x index is split between processes and each process owns Np 2D slices, 
where Np = N/num_processes

process 0 owns 0:Np
process 1 owns Np:2*Np
        .
process rank owns rank*Np:(rank+1)*Np

The variables are globally U[3, N, N, N], etc.,
where the last three indices are laid out in x, y, z direction.
Chunks of the global matrices live on each process

  U[:, 0:Np,    :, :] lives on process 0
  U[:, Np:2*Np, :, :] lives on process 1
  etc.

Convection requires communication.
Each process does its own fft2 on its 2D slices

Responsibility for performing remaining one-dimensional fft in x-direction
is also split between processes. This is done by allocating slices to
processes just like the regular ownership, but in z-direction. Of the global
matrix the following responsibilities are given

 process 0:  U[:, :, :Np]  
 process 1:  U[:, :, Np:2*Np]
 etc

To perform the operations in x-direction the following matrix is needed

 Ut[:, :, Np]

where fft is performed along axis 0 fft(Ut, axis=0)
